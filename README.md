# Joker Frontend

![joker](./joker.jpeg)

## Description

The frontend interface for Joker, an online social game built with modern web technologies. Features real-time gameplay, responsive design, and intuitive user interactions.

## "Why?"

I've always been fascinated by social games after playing offline party games like "È¨ºÁâå" (a German social deduction game) with friends. These games create amazing moments of connection and laughter, but I noticed a common problem: we'd often run out of interesting questions or prompts, which would kill the momentum.

So I built this backend system that provides a flexible, extensible question database with real-time capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Navigate to [joker.jienian.tw](https://joker.jienian.tw) and start your social game!

Create rooms, add questions, and play with friends instantly.
